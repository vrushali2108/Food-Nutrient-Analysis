# Food Nutrient Analysis

### **Description** -
This project aims to explore and analyze the nutritional composition of food items using a dataset of 7058 food products. By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to calories, protein, fats, vitamins, and minerals present in various foods. The analysis provides valuable knowledge for those interested in nutrition science, diet planning, or machine learning applications in food classification and health tracking.

### **Project Objectives** -
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Descriptive Analysis: Summarize key nutritional features, such as calories, protein, fats, carbohydrates, sodium, and vitamins.
- Data Visualization: Use visual tools like bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to reveal patterns in nutrient distribution.
- Feature Engineering: Identify useful features for predictive modeling, like total fat, sugar content, and vitamin composition.
- Insights and Recommendations: Highlight key takeaways for dietary analysis and potential machine learning applications

### **DataSet Overview** -
This repository contains a comprehensive Food Nutrition Dataset with detailed nutritional information for 7058 food items. Each entry includes key nutritional attributes such as calories, protein, total fat, carbohydrates, sodium, and various vitamins and minerals. The dataset can be used for a wide range of applications, including health and fitness tracking, dietary analysis, and machine learning projects related to nutrition prediction or food classification. With 16 well-defined columns, including a unique ID and a descriptive name for each food item, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for both data science enthusiasts and health researchers. Missing values in certain fields like sodium, sugar, and some vitamins have been noted, which may require data cleaning or imputation for analysis. This repository aims to provide a solid foundation for exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building predictive models for nutrition-based use cases

### **Tools and Technologies**-
- Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
  Libraries Used:
- Pandas: For data wrangling and manipulation.
- NumPy: For numerical calculations.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and creating insightful plots.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and step-by-step analysis.

### **Analysis Highlights**-
- Data Cleaning: Missing values were found in Sodium, Sugar, Calcium, Iron, Potassium, VitaminC, VitaminE, and VitaminD. Appropriate techniques were used to handle these missing values.
- Caloric Distribution: Visualized the distribution of calories across food items, identifying high-calorie items for potential health recommendations.
- Protein Analysis: Explored protein content to identify foods rich in protein, such as meat, dairy, and legumes.
- Correlation Analysis: Identified relationships between nutrients (e.g., correlation between total fat and saturated fat).
- Insights on Sugar and Sodium: Highlighted foods with excessive sugar or sodium content, which may be useful for health-conscious users.

### **Visualizations Included** -
- Histograms: To visualize the distribution of numerical features like calories, protein, and fat.
- Box Plots: To detect outliers in nutrient content for each food item.
- Heatmaps: To visualize the correlation between nutritional features.
- Scatter Plots: To explore relationships between individual nutrients.

### **How to Use This Project** -
This repository can be used for the following purposes:

- Data Analysis: Conduct your own analysis on food nutrients and dietary insights.
- Machine Learning: Use this dataset to build predictive models for food classification, diet recommendations, or health-related AI applications.
- Educational Purposes: Learn how to perform EDA, data cleaning, and visualization using Python.
